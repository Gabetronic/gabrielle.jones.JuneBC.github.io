/**
* CONTROL FLOW:
* 0. If you wanted the Javascript interpreter to execute some code only if a value is true or 
* false, essentially, you need to control the flow of the code's execution.
* 1. If is an operator used to check if a condition is true. 
* 2. Else-if is the next operator in the flow, or chain used to check truth, only after the previous if statement fails.
* 3. Else is the last operator in the flow, used after all other conditional statements are proven false.
* 4. Switch statements are a simpler way to test the value of an expression against multiple cases.
