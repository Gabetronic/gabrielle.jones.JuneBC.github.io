/**
* FUNCTIONS:
*0. Intro to section
*
*
*Concept explanation + a working code example + comment of what should turn/print:
* 1. Two phases to using func: declaration + call/invocation
* 2. Parameters vs. Args
* 3. Syntax for Func Declaration (a named func)
* 4. How to assign a func to a variable?
* 5. Since, functions can optionally take inputs & return values - How do we specify inputs & outputs?
* 6. Scope: funcs can see and modify var in parent/global scope.  Why is the inverse not true?
* 7. Closures: Funcs form closures around the data they house.  If an obj returned from the func is held in memory somewhere else(referenced), the closure stays 'alive', & the data can continue to exist in these closures.
